# University Subjects

Here, I will be publishing some of the completed assignments I received during my studies at the university. Each folder contains the completed work from each individual subject.

- **KUI (Cybernetics and Artificial Intelligence):** This subject covers algorithms for state-space search, including search under uncertainty.
- **PRG (Programming in C):** An introduction to programming in the C language.
- **ALP (Algorithms and Programming):** An introduction to programming in the Python language.
- **LSP (Logic Systems and Processors):** This subject is about basic hardware structures of computing devices, their design, and architecture.
- **JVC (How to Make (Almost) Anything):** This course focuses on fundamental methods of creating things for engineers. The curriculum included practice in 3D modeling, 3D printing, microcontroller programming, application development, and much more. Detailed documentation of all projects can be found on my personal [website](https://zhytnboh-b232-b3b35jvc-d273ec0bf743d6f444c5ce043f527fd847541c4b.pages.fel.cvut.cz/).
